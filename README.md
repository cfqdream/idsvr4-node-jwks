# Securing Node APIs with tokens from IdentityServer4 using JWKS

## Intro

This quickstart / sample shows how can you secure a Node (Express) API using [IdentityServer4](http://identityserver.io/) as the security token service.
Specifically, it uses the [JWKS](https://auth0.com/docs/jwks) endpoint and RS256 algorithm.

We will use 2 modules from [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to deal with JWTs & JWKS:

- [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt)
- [jwks-rsa](https://github.com/auth0/node-jwks-rsa)


## Background

For further background on using RS256 & JWKS in Node apps, consider this [excellent article](https://auth0.com/blog/navigating-rs256-and-jwks/) which explains basically how the _jwks-rsa_ module works.

IdentityServer provides a JWKS endpoint at the URI specified with the `jwks_uri` key in the discovery document available from `/.well-known/openid-configuration`. By default, this is located at `/.well-known/openid-configuration/jwks` so in this sample, we can access it at http://localhost:5000/.well-known/openid-configuration/jwks.

## Repo Structure

This repo contains 4 sample projects:

- **idserv4** - IdentityServer4 setup with user authentication as per the [Quickstarts #3](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstarts/3_interactive_login.html) from the official docs. We also setup a self-signed certificate (cert.pfx) for credential signing that will be explained below. When running, this will be accessible at http://localhost:5000 
- **console** - Sample .NET Core 2.0 Console app as per the ["Creating the client"](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstarts/1_client_credentials.html#creating-the-client) section from the docs.  This app demonstrates using the ClientCredentials grant type to obtain the access token from IdentityServer and use it to call the sample Node API at http://localhost:5002/me
- **node-api** - Node Express based sample API which is the whole point of this repo!  This is hosted at http://localhost:5002 by default.  There's only 1 Javascript file (index.js) that shows the implementation, but it's documented with useful comments and should be fairly easy to follow.
- **client** - Javascript OIDC client based on the [JsOidc sample](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Samples/tree/release/Clients/src/JsOidc). This uses [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) to host the client app.  The "Call API" button is configured to access the Node API at http://localhost:5002/me

  Two test users are configured with username/password: `bob/bob` and `alice/alice` that you can use to login.

## Setup the signing certificate

In order for IdentityServer to support signing JWTs with RS256, we need to configure it to use a signing certificate. This is basically done by supplying an _X509Certificate2_ to the `AddSigningCredential` extension method in _Startup_:

```C#
// File: idserv4/Startup.cs

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddIdentityServer()
        .AddSigningCredential(Config.GetSigningCertificate(_env.ContentRootPath))
        .AddInMemoryApiResources(Config.GetApiResources())
        .AddInMemoryIdentityResources(Config.GetIdentityResources())
        .AddInMemoryClients(Config.GetClients())
        .AddTestUsers(TestUsers.Users);
}
```

```C#
// File: idserv4/Config.cs

public class Config
{
    internal static X509Certificate2 GetSigningCertificate(string rootPath)
    {
        var fileName = Path.Combine(rootPath, "cert.pfx");

        if(!File.Exists(fileName)) {
            throw new FileNotFoundException("Signing Certificate is missing!");
        }

        var cert = new X509Certificate2(fileName);
        return cert;
    }

...
```

Included in the sample is a self-signed PFX (`cert.pfx`) generated using OpenSSL.  You can generate your own self-signed certs using the following commands:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert.pem -inkey key.pem -out cert.pfx
```

### OpenSSL on Windows

As an aside, you can get OpenSSL for Windows [from here](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html). For supporting Node development on Windows, I recommend getting the older v1.0.2L instead due to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38968884/link-fatal-error-lnk1181cannot-open-input-file-c-openssl-win64-lib-libeay32/39270114#39270114).

### Other methods

Instead of using OpenSSL, you can also [use Powershell](https://www.petri.com/create-self-signed-certificate-using-powershell) to generate self-signed certs.


## Securing Node APIs

The main gist of how to do this is defined with the `auth` middleware in the sample Node app:

```javascript
// File: node-api/index.js

// reference to IdentityServer instance
const issuer = 'http://localhost:5000';     // can potentially use the "iss" claim from the access token instead

// define authentication middleware
const auth = jwt({
    secret: jwksClient.expressJwtSecret({
        cache: true,        // see https://github.com/auth0/node-jwks-rsa#caching
        rateLimit: true,    // see https://github.com/auth0/node-jwks-rsa#rate-limiting
        jwksRequestsPerMinute: 2,
        jwksUri: `${issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration/jwks`      // we are hardcoding the default location of the JWKS Uri here - but another approach is to get the value from the discovery endpoint
    }),

    // validate the audience & issuer from received token vs JWKS endpoint
    audience: 'api1',
    issuer: issuer,
    algorithms: ['RS256']
});

...
```
Here we specify the IdentityServer4 instance (http://localhost:5000), and setup some options on the `jwks-rsa` module. This module supports validating the scope in the token against a specific audience (`api1` in this case).

## How to use (with Docker)

1. Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lyphtec/idserv4-node-jwk
    cd idserv4-node-jwks
    ```
1. Run docker-compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
1. Access the client app at http://localhost:5005

## How to use (without Docker)

1. Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lyphtec/idserv4-node-jwks
    cd idserv4-node-jwks
    ```
1. Run IdentityServer:
    ```bash
    cd src/idserv4
    dotnet restore
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```
    Check that it's up & running at http://localhost:5000/.well-known/openid-configuration

    Check that JWKS endpoint has been setup correctly with RS256 at http://localhost:5000/.well-known/openid-configuration/jwks.  There should be `x5t` & `x5c` properties for the JWK. _x5c_ is the public key of our certificate.
1. Open a new console & startup the Node API:
    ```bash
    cd src/node-api
    yarn install    # (or npm install)
    yarn start      # (or npm start)
    ```
    Check that it's up & running at http://localhost:5002.  It should return "Hello"

    If we try to access the "secured" API at http://localhost:5002/me using a browser, it should return a 401 as we haven't passed the access token into the authorization _Bearer_ header.
1. Open another console & run the sample "console" app:
    ```bash
    cd /src/console
    dotnet restore
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```
    The decoded payload from the access token should match the claims returned from the secured Node API endpoint.
1. Run the sample client Javascript app:
    ```bash
    cd /src/client
    yarn install    # (or npm install)
    yarn start      # (or npm start)
    ```
    App should be up & running at http://localhost:5005

Our Node API is now secured by IdentityServer!
